# matcodes

In this repository I included two codes being developed in matlab/octave enviroment.

# ex1 

ex1.m is about EEG signal processing and analysis using Butterworth IIR Filters
in Delta, Theta, Alpha and Beta brain wave frequencies.

# ex2

ex2.m is about creating a compatible High-pass filter so that the noise be cut out of the audio sample

# comments

every code includes further explanatory comments

# future features

future goal is to include more codes as such
